# Code of Conduct

Show & Tell is a micro-community of solo founders sharing their experiences and helping each another.

We want to make sure that we create a kind and welcoming atmosphere for everyone, and this Code of Conduct is provided to give clear guidelines on how best we can do that.

## Our standards

Show & Tell is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, ethnicity, nationality, race, or religion (or lack thereof), education, or socio-economic status.

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Being kind to others
* Behaving professionally
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Accepting constructive criticism graciously

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Using sexual language or sending sexual imagery to other members
* Violent threats or language directed against another person
* Insults or put-downs
* Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
* Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Sustained or repeated interruptions of other members

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, we will take appropriate action. This may include a verbal warning or in severe cases, removal from the group.

## Scope

All Show & Tell participants are expected to adhere to the Code of Conduct during Slack discussions and video chat sessions.

## Reporting concerns

If someone violates the code of conduct and you feel uncomfortable discussing it with them, reach out to DK via email or Slack.
