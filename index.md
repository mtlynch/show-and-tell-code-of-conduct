# Code of Conduct

The Show & Tell group is meant to facilitate networking and collaboration within the indie founder community.

We value the participation of each member of Show & Tell and want all attendees to have an enjoyable, fulfilling experience. All attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to others throughout the cohort.

Everyone who participates in Show & Tell must adhere to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code in Slack channels and during video chat sessions.

## Our standards

Show & Tell is dedicated to providing a positive event experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, ethnicity, nationality, race, or religion (or lack thereof), education, or socio-economic status.

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Being kind to others
* Behaving professionally
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Accepting constructive criticism graciously

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Using sexual language or sending sexual imagery to other members
* Violent threats or language directed against another person
* Insults or put-downs
* Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
* Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Sustained or repeated interruptions of other members

Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, the Show & Tell organizers will take appropriate action. This may include a verbal warning or removal from the group.

## Scope

All Show & Tell participants are subject to the Code of Conduct during Slack discussions and video chat sessions.

## Reporting concerns

If someone violates the code of conduct and you feel uncomfortable discussing it with them, reach out to DK either via email or Slack.
